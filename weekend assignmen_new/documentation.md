//////////////////creating an interactive experuence//////////
A person tied to the busy corporate life, he lost his face emotions and everything in the process. he is going back to home and on the way he regains his face the colrs and the life he lost.

first the office scene where the peron is sitting infront of laptop and clicking mouse then the scene is changing where he is walking throigh traffic(here 10 print patterns are used as background amd walking sprite is overlayed). for walking we have to press right arrow keys .then sitting in the train and background city light is changing in the background with person sitting as the overlay. then slowly the background image(city) will change to green color and his familiar places, ike reconnecting with the peaceful life. he will se the forest trees and all. and solwly his face will become bright, his features and emotions will appear(indicating him regaining him self back). so here there are some music and some interactions planned like putting earphones, calls and all.
//////////////////////

/////////////Issues/////////
